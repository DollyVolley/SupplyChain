Backlog:

refactor: Controller
Introduce tabs or at least dedicated sections to correlated operations
{create twin, request_asset}

introduce sim tags
:hover -> show information how this would be done in production

introduce edu tags
:hover -> provide in-depth knowledge what the people can see here.

powerup: request_asset
introduce listener which notificates decision
maybe post-chrysalis-update due to network dependency (R.I.P. Client Libs)

dry mode:
make dry simulation mode without actual transactions

MAM mode:
public, private or restricted
